# vim internal
1. GitGutter shortcuts, show hunk, etc! Revert, and stuff like that.
    - GitGutter rehash on save.
    - Also fix colorscheme slightly.
    - Stage hunk,
    - show staged in signcolumn
    - Jump through hunks
2. Fugitive shortcuts, merging, staging, etc. // Maybe dont do this, and just use gitgutter for everything
3. Fix the cwd issue... Which allows me to jump from the folder.
    * Also fixes the navigation issue, where I only want to look from the current file
- Add 'file'-mode, which activates upon loading a rails project (or python, or c, etc...). leader-f-<x>
    * CocList current file folders (Preferably like ivy-filer..., allows me to step out)
    * --number-select
    * CocListResume
    * CocList for [models, specs, controllers, views, and 'everything else']
    * Multiple selection. 
    * Coc.nvim statuses
- Change folds and such.
4. Add RO, and stuff like that to the statusbar (Using that other persons statusbar/crystalline)
5. Show path from WorkspaceFolders in the statusbar, or from CWD as a fallback, perhaps also do "smart shorten"
6. Show git status (staged, etc) to the statusline, maybe how much it differs from origin (or master) 
7. Add Light color scheme swap.
8. Adapt statusbar to the current split type. Check how this is done and how it is possible. Maybe crystalline instead of default?
9. Fix window keybindings
10. Move folds elsewhere
11. Add some sort of #todo plugin
12. CocList todos or something like that

# ruby
1. Read a book!
2. Do the ticket I was assigned


# yabai
1. move displays using direction
2. alt-tab should swap workspace, not display!
3. some-key plus moving the trackpad should do something fancy, like changing focus really easily? (Super high sense?)


# fish
1. git branch in prompt

# external (other stuff)
1. Work on keybindings!
2. Clean up dotfiles, maybe split into different repositories
3. alacritty

# to think about (what part of my workflow do I want to improve / things I don't want to forget)
